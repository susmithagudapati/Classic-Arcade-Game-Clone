===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


Instructions on how to run and play the game
============================================

1. Open the game in your browser.
2. You get to see the bugs running and a player waiting for your help to reach the water.
3. You will have to use the arrow keys to move the player.
	**-> up arrow to move the player near to the water.**
	**-> down arrow to move the player down inorder to save from the bugs.**
	**-> left arrow to move the player left side.**
	**-> right arrow to move the player right side.**
4. All you have to do is to send the player from grass level to water level.
5. Be careful with the bugs! If the player encounters the bug, then you loose the game.
6. If you reach the water level without being hit by the bugs, you win the game!!!
